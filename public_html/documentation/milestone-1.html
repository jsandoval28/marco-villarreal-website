<strong>Proficiency:</strong><ul>
    <li>Although Jack likes to have the most up-to-date
        Apple technology, he is not very proficient with
        technology. He is an older man and regularly asks
        his son to help him with technical problems that
        arise. Jack is proficient enough, however, to browse
        the internet on both of his devices, to send text messages
        and emails, and to use the apps on his phone.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Jack finds this website while searching the internet
    for a Behavioral Health Billing specialist located in
    Albuquerque, New Mexico. Jack is frustrated because his
    previous medical billing specialists either quit or found
    new jobs. Jack finds this website and is impressed with how
    well laid out all the information is and how nice the styling
    looks. Jack's goal with searching for a behavioral health
    billing specialist was to find one worthy of hiring. Jack is
    intrigued by the website and is contacting Marco for an interview.
